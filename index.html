        <p>Hi everyone, My name is Weixiang Lou and you can call me Peter. I came from China and I have been here for 5 years as an international student.I graduated from Information Technology program so I have a little bit experience about website and programming. Because I like web design and I would like to make it as my future career, I come to Humber to continue study.

        <h2 class="sub-heading">Pets</h2>
        <p>As you can see at the top of this page, I have two pets, one dog one cat. The Cat is called Ader, he is 3 years old Ragdoll. And the Dog is called Lucas, he is a 7 years old Samoyed. Both of them are fed by raw meat, so they have very beautiful and smooth hair. Ader was abandoned by my friend's friend. So my girlfriend and I adopted him. Lucas came from China as well. He is a nice and quiet dog.
